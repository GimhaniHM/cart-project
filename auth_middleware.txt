The code imports necessary external libraries and local modules.
TokenClaims is assumed to be a struct representing the claims inside a JSON Web Token (JWT).
actix_web is the web framework for Rust.
futures is used for working with asynchronous futures in Rust.
jsonwebtoken is a library for working with JSON Web Tokens.

The FromRequest trait allows you to create reusable request guards. In this case, it's used to create an authorization guard.
The from_request function is implemented for AuthorizationService.
It extracts the "Authorization" header from the request (_req.headers().get("Authorization")).
If the header is found (Some(_)), it attempts to extract the JWT token from the header.
The token is then decoded using the provided secret key and validated using the HS256 algorithm.
If the token is valid, an instance of AuthorizationService is returned wrapped in a Result::Ok.
If the token is invalid, an ErrorUnauthorized error is returned wrapped in a Result::Err.
If there is no "Authorization" header (None), an ErrorUnauthorized error is returned indicating that the request is blocked.
In summary, this code provides a middleware function for Actix web applications that can be used to authenticate requests based on JWT tokens provided in the "Authorization" header. It checks the validity of the token using a secret key and the HS256 algorithm, allowing authorized requests to proceed and blocking unauthorized ones.
